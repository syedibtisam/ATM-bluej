# ATM Simulation

## Description

This project is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system developed using Java in the BlueJ development environment. It serves as a lab exercise where the code creates the ATM interface, but certain methods in the `Bank` and `BankAccount` classes, which perform the actual banking functions, are incomplete. The exercise involves completing these methods to achieve a fully functional ATM simulation.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implementing a login method in the `Bank` class to find a bank account using a username and password.
- **Account Management**: Completing methods in the `BankAccount` class to handle:
  - **Withdrawals**: Allowing users to withdraw funds from their accounts.
  - **Deposits**: Enabling users to deposit funds into their accounts.
  - **Balance Inquiry**: Providing users with the ability to check their account balance.

## Tech Stack

- Java

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedibtisam/ATM-bluej.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in BlueJ**:
   - Launch BlueJ.
   - Open the cloned project directory.

3. **Complete the following methods**:
   - In the `Bank` class, implement the `login` method to find a bank account using a username and password.
   - In the `BankAccount` class, implement the `withdraw`, `deposit`, and `balance` methods to perform the respective banking operations.

4. **Run the project**:
   - Compile all classes.
   - Create an instance of the `Main` class and invoke its `main` method to start the ATM simulation.

## Educational Purpose

This project is intended for educational purposes to help understand and implement basic banking operations within an ATM system using Java. It provides hands-on experience in completing and integrating core functionalities in a simulated environment.
